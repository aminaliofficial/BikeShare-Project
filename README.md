# BikeShare Data Exploration Project - Data Analysis Professional Track

## Introduction
This is the first project in udacity **Data Analysis Professional Track** which we study how to use python in data analysis.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on ``pandas`` library usage and simple statistics methods to perform descriptive analysis on the bikeshare data from three major
U.S. cities: **Chicago, Washington, and New York City** to display information such as most popular days or most common stations.

### Program Details

The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. January; also includes an 'all' option),
and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Monday; also includes an 'all' option).

Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not.
Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.

## Data
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv


## Requirement
* Visual Studio Code
* Python 3.9
* Python Libraries : Pandas, Time

## Running Program
You can input 'python BikeShare.py' on your terminal to run this program. I use Cmder on a Windows 10 machine.
